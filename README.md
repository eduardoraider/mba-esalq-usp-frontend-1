*HTML* (Hypertext Markup Language) and *CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets) are two fundamental languages for web page development. They play distinct but complementary roles in the creation and styling of web pages.

# Product Store Project

This project consists of a web page for a fictional product store where users can view information about products such as images, descriptions, prices, and offers. The page is styled with CSS to provide a pleasant visual experience.

## Page Structure

#### Header
The header of the page contains the store name and a navigation bar with links to different product categories. The header is styled with a dark background color and white text, providing an attractive contrast.

#### Products
The product section displays a list of items, each with an image, name, description, price, and offer information. The products are presented in separate boxes with subtle shadows to add depth. They are organized in a flexible grid that automatically adjusts to the width of the user's device screen.

#### Footer
The footer of the page contains copyright information and is styled with a dark background color and white text, matching the header style.

#### Style Details
- The header style includes a centered navigation bar with links to product categories.
- Products are displayed in a flexible grid with even spacing between items.
- Each product item has a border, a soft shadow, and internal padding to visually highlight the content.
- Product images occupy the full width of their respective boxes.
- Product prices are displayed with original prices crossed out (strikethrough) and discount prices in red.
- Free shipping information is provided for each product.
- The cursor changes to a hand when hovering over the items, indicating that they are clickable.
